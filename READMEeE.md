- 👩‍💻 Hello, I’m Mahalah. 🤗 How are you? I did not expect you to find me here but Maybe there are things we can work on together. I'll be glad to know.

I’m interested in different random things, I change everytime. I don't if it's being adaptable or unstable? 😂
🩵 Currently I'm working on developing good traits and learning how to learn (in Computer Science area).

👾 I’m looking to collaborate on learning how to code, problem solving, presenting ideas, reading programs, asking for help haha, helping people, and the list goes on. 
- 🕶 Contact me if you want to know! at https://m.me/mah.ismael1y
I'm excited to find new people having the same goals.
