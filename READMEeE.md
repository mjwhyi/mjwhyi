👩‍💻 Hello, I’m Mahalah. 🤗 How are you today? I did not expect you to find me here but since you did, I now think there are some things we both like and we can work on together.

I’m interested in random things, I change everytime. I don't if it's being adaptable or unstable? 😂
🩵 Currently, I'm working on developing good traits (interpersonal skills) and learning how to learn (about Computer Science).

👾 I’m looking to collaborate on mastering how to code, problem solving, presenting ideas, reading programs, asking for help haha, helping people, and the list goes on...
- 🕶 Contact me if you want to know! at https://m.me/mah.ismael1y
I'm excited to find new people having the same goals.
